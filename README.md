# Conway's Game of Life

An interactive browser-based implementation of **Conway’s Game of Life**, built and maintained by [Spoutcodes](https://github.com/Spoutcodes).

## Overview
This version of the Game of Life is a modern, high-performance take on the classic cellular automaton. It is written entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no dependencies, just clean, efficient code.

## Features
- Full-screen responsive canvas  
- Continuous drawing and erasing  
- Infinite grid expansion logic  
- Zooming and panning  
- Undo and redo (Ctrl/Cmd + Z / Y)  
- Preset patterns (Glider, Pulsar, Gosper Glider Gun, LWSS)  
- Custom confirmation popups (no browser alerts)  
- SVG icon controls  
- Caching-optimized file separation  
- Light and dark theme–compatible favicon  

## Performance
- **Cold load:** ~2 seconds on GitHub Pages CDN  
- **Warm load:** ~2 seconds or less after caching  
- Static delivery through GitHub Pages with browser caching benefits for CSS and JS assets.
